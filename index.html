        <h2>About me</h2>
        <div class="divider"></div>

        <p>
          I am a theoretical astrophysicist working on the evolution, interactions,
          and mergers of massive stars across cosmic time. My research combines
          stellar evolution modelling and population synthesis to understand how
          binaries and mergers shape the brightest stars in galaxies, their
          chemical enrichment, and the progenitors of core-collapse supernovae and gravitational-wave sources.
          My main numerical tools are: MESA for stellar evolution, JINA-NuGrid for nucleosynthesis calculations and PHOEBE for light curve modelling
          and data extraction. 
        </p>

       <p> As of October 2025, I have donned the observer's hat for the first time, after winning 6 nights through NSF's NOIRLab on the 4m SOAR telescope, Chile. I am leading the 
         largest focused observing campaign on short-period massive contact binaries in the Magellanic Clouds, overseeing data acquisition, reduction and extraction. 
         This will lead to a homogeneously analysed collection of light curves and radial velocity data on these enigmatic "peanut stars" with periods under 1 day, that are likely on their way to merge.     
        <p>
          I am currently based at Columbia University (2024-2027), where I balance an active
          research program as a postdoctoral fellow, while teaching the Core “Frontiers of Science” course.
